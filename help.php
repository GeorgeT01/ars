<center><h2>Reservations & Ticket Support</h2> </center>
Do you have questions about your reservation? Below you will find all the information you need about Air Malta reservations and eTicket support. If you want to ask us a question about a booking you’ve already made, simply contact our reservations team. <br/> <br/> <br/>


<strong>When booking online:</strong>  Once you start the booking process, if you lose your internet connection or take too long to move onto the next step, you might receive an error message. If this happens, please login to MyKM to check if your booking has gone through. If you cannot find the details on your dashboard then you can try booking again. <br/> <br/>

<strong>Mistake in passenger details:</strong>  While you are making your booking, you will be notified of the charges you might incur if you need to change details after payment. If you realise that you made a mistake whilst inputting passenger details following the authorisation of payment, you need to contact our reservations team immediately to check whether this error can be corrected upon payment of applicable charges.
 <br/> <br/>
<strong>Upgrading your ticket:</strong> If you want to upgrade your ticket from Economy to Club, you can call our International Call Centre. You will be asked to quote your booking reference code (PNR) which can be found on the ticket and is made up of six letters.  <br/> <br/>

If you're trying to use your KMiles to do upgrade your flight, please contact flypass.email@something.com <br/> <br/>

<strong>Next of kin details:</strong> During the booking process, you will be required to insert the basic contact information of a relative or friend, for our use in case of an emergency only. This information will not be used in case of flight changes or cancellations or for marketing purposes. <br/> <br/>

<strong>Ticket transfers:</strong> If you’re travelling with Air Malta, you can transfer your ticket to someone else. This depends on the availability of seats in the same class of service, otherwise the ticket will need to be upgraded to the next available fare. A ticket transfer fee will also apply. A consent form needs to be fully filled and signed by the original ticket holder. Once filled in, you need to forward this form together with a copy of his/her passport or ID card on teamleaders.airmalta@airmalta.com. The change will not be affected if the form and identification copy for the original ticket holder is not received.<br/><br/>

<strong>Lost or misplaced tickets:</strong> If this happens for an online booking, don’t panic! We will still have your details, and your dashboard will give you an overview of your next flight. Simply login to your MyKM account to view the flight details and then present your passport at check-in.<br/><br/>

If your ticket was a traditional paper ticket issued directly by Air Malta, you should call our reservations team or visit your nearest sales office and we will replace your ticket against a charge. If your ticket was issued by a travel agent and not directly by our airline, you first need to contact your agent to obtain the relevant documentation. We will only be able to issue a replacement ticket when all relevant details are provided.<br/><br/>

<strong>Booking for infants and children:</strong>  On all travel classes, when booking for a child or infant you are eligible for a discounted price. We consider a child to be an Infant up to the day before he/she is 2 years of age. Children refers to those passengers between the ages of 2 and 12 years.<br/><br/>

<strong>Remember.</strong> If your infant will reach his/her second birthday before the return segment of the air ticket is used, we will classify him/her as a child for the return segment. At this stage, reservations for such cases may be made with our reservations team, Air Malta sales offices or your travel agent. <br/><br/>

Open tickets:  If you want to visit one of our destinations but are not yet sure of a return date, an open return ticket is the answer. At the moment these can only be purchased by calling our International Call Centre or visiting one of our sales offices.<br/><br/>
